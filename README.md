# Project-Euler-Solutions
My solutions for the problems on the website [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Going through the problems and posting my code is intended as a personal academic exercise. As recommended by the website, please don't look through the code until you've done the problems yourself, lest you rob yourself of the pleasure of doing it yourself.

That being said, feel free to look through the code and provide any comments or critique.
